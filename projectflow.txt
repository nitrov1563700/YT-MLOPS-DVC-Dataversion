1. Create git repo and clone it in local.
2. create mycode.py and add code to it. (it will sava a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initalizing dvc.
# pip install dvc
4. dvc init
5. Now do "mkdir S3"
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/"
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached data" and "git commit -m 'stop tracking data'")
   Because initially we were tracking data /folder from git and now we remove it for DVC to handle. 
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add data.dvc .gitignore" 
9. Now we do "dvc commit" and then "dvc push" to push data.dvc to remote.
10. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
